[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/greenbone/ospd-netstat/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/greenbone/ospd-netstat/?branch=master)

This is an OSP server implementation to allow GVM to remotely control the
`netstat` tool.

`ospd-netstat` can collect open ports on the local system.

Once running, you need to configure the Scanner for Greenbone Vulnerability
Manager, for example via the web interface Greenbone Security Assistant.
Then you can create scan tasks to use this scanner.

## Installation

### Requirements

Python 3 and later is supported.

Beyond the [ospd base library](https://github.com/greenbone/ospd),
`ospd-netstat` has dependencies on the following Python package:

- `paramiko`

There are no special installation aspects for this module beyond the general
installation guide for ospd-based scanners.

Please follow the general installation guide for ospd-based scanners:

  <https://github.com/greenbone/ospd/blob/master/doc/INSTALL-ospd-scanner.md>

## Usage

Starting a scan requires an SSH credential parameter because `ospd-netstat`
needs to login on the target systems to run the locally installed `netstat`
tool.

Apart from this, there are no special usage aspects for this module beyond the
generic usage guide.

Please follow the general usage guide for ospd-based scanners:
